In Assignment 1 I proved the Radon Niko derivative, calculated probabilities using Random Walk and Gambler's Ruin using Python 

In Assignment 2 I proved the Central Limit Theorem, Chain differentiation theorem with financial variables and plotted Brownian Motion graph using Matplotlib in Python

In Options I plotted graphs various options like Long Call, Long Put, Short Call, Short Put, Long Straddle, Strangle using Python 

In Final Project I used scipy.stats to price a Put option using Black-Scholes model and also separately using Binomial Model
